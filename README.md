# Module-2-VBA        
   
Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:    
1. The ticker symbol/s. 
2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the desired stock. 

Added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and the "Greatest total volume".
